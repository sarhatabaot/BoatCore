Core Library for bukkit plugin development

A lot of inspiration+adaption of code from <https://github.com/kangarko/Foundation>.

This is my personal library for plugin development. If you want something more stable use Foundation.
This library does not have to be shaded into your plugin, you can just place it in your server\plugins folder.
